# Transaction ID Proof of Concept

request -> router, add unique (for how long?) transaction id to request -> <resolved route>

echo route 



Add transaction id to every request
use the transaction id to track request throughout the system and compile log 

# TODO
1. Encode messages using protobuf
1. Make subscriber which aggregates messages by transaction id
